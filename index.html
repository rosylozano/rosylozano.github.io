      <h2>BIO:</h2>
      <h3>I am a fifteen-year-old girl from Fremont, CA. I am a rising junior
        and most excited about new clubs this upcoming school year. I live with
        my parents, older sister, and younger brother. I also live with my two
        cats named Kiki and Golcha.</h3>

      <h2>LIKES:</h2>
      <h3>I like to read, write, and listen to music. My favorite subjects are
        History and English. I like to try new food from different
        nations/culture. I like to play volleyball and Minecraft.
      </h3>

    <div>
      <h2>DISLIKES:</h2>
      <h3>I <em>really</em> dislike seafood, onions, and enchiladas. I struggle
        the most when it comes to math and science. Although I'm a deep sleeper,
        I hate it when there's any noise as I go to sleep.</h3>

    <div>
      <h2>FAVORITE WEBSITES:</h2>
    <!-- href is always put in front for websites -->
      <h3>My favorite websites are <a href="https://www.latimes.com/">LA Times</a>
        and <a href="https://www.ecosia.org/">Ecosia</a>. I like to read news
        from LA Times because I think they covered somewhat interesting news. I
        find Ecosia useful because for each time a person uses the search engine,
        a tree is planted.</h3>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>FAVORITE PEOPLE:</h2>
      <h3>I have many people that I look up to. A few would include family
        members such as my mom, my dad, my older sister, and my sister's boyfriend.
        Others would include Elon Musk, and Ava DuVernay.</h3>
